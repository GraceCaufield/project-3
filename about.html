    <p>
        My Name is Grace Caufield. I am a senior at the University of Monatana. I am majoring in art with a minor in media arts. I have an expected graduation date of December 2024. I am originally from Livermore, California. 
    </br>
</br>
        I started making art when I was a freshman in high school. I originally started out as a painter, and have since learned a variety of different styles and mediums. I am now looking to pursue a career in digital art, illustration, writing and animation. 
    </br>
    <br>
        In  my free time, you can find me reading, writing, watching cartoons, or teaching art lessons to elementary school students. And, of course, drawing!
